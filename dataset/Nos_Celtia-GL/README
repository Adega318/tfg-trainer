DESCRIPTION

Galician TTS single speaker corpus of approximately 25 hours of speech.
Nos_Celtia-GL is a phonetically and morphosyntactically balanced corpus of 20,000 phrases (approximately 200,000 words) comprising two subcorpora: a previously compiled corpus created by the Grupo de Tecnoloxías Multimedia (GTM), together with the Centro Ramón Piñeiro para a Investigación en Humanidades (CRPIH), and a corpus compiled by the Nós Project from multi-domain texts. 
The text corpus statistics are detailed in the table below:

While the Nós subcorpus has undergone a thorough linguistic review, we have decided not to adapt the GTM corpus to the current grammatical norms of the Galician language with a view to obtaining a parallel corpus to the previously recorded cirp_uvigo_gl_sabela.

Nos_Celtia-GL was recorded in a controlled environment (recording studio) by a professional female voice talent selected among four speakers through a perceptual listening test in which more than 50 participants assessed the speakers’ clarity, prosody, likeability, and language proficiency. 

The file naming scheme of the audio files consists of a series of lowercase elements indicating the type of audio (raw), the creators of the corpus (nos), the name of the voice (celtia), and the ISO code for the Galician language (gl), followed by a 5-digit number identifying the utterance. All components are separated by underscores (e. g., raw_nos_celtia_gl_00001.wav).

Metadata is provided in “metadata.csv”. This file consists of one record per line, delimited by the vertical bar character (0x7c). The fields are:
  1. Audio file: name of the corresponding .wav file
  2. Transcription: non-normalized text read by speaker (UTF-8)

The audio files are available in the format in which they were originally recorded, 48 kHz, 16-bit WAV format, and amount to approximately 25 hours.
Version 1.0.0 contains the raw sound files with no editing nor normalization, together with the corresponding text.
